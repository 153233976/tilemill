If TileMill isn't starting up or performing properly, try these troubleshooting steps. This page is for **Mac OS X**. We also have instructions for [Ubuntu](/tilemill/docs/linux-troubleshooting) and [Windows](/tilemill/docs/win-troubleshooting).

## Check the logs

1. If TileMill is open, choose "Console" from the "Window" menu. If TileMill isn't open and won't start up, open the "Console" application by going to "Applications > Utilities".
2. Once the Console application is open, select "TileMill.log" from the list.

3. Copy the log contents and paste it into a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) to share it with support staff.
