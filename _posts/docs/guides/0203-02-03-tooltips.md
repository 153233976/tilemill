Tooltips allow you to make your maps interactive with dynamic content that appears when you hover over or click on your map. The tooltips can contain HTML and are useful for revealing additional data, images, or other content.

In the [tutorial on adding layers](/tilemill/docs/tutorials/point-data), you created a map of earthquakes. Here, you can add tooltips that reveal the magnitude, date, and time of each quake when the user hovers over its point.

1. Open the **Settings** panel by clicking on the wrench button.

2. Click on the **Tooltips** tab.

3. Select the **earthquakes** layer to use it for interaction. TileMill only supports one interactive layer at a time.

4. The data fields for the layer are displayed wrapped in curly [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) tags. These tags will be replaced by data when you interact with the map. Locate the fields you want to use.

5. Write your template using the Mustache tags. **Teaser** content appears when you hover over a feature and **Full** content appears when you click on the feature. You can use the **Location** field to define a URL to be loaded when a feature is clicked. Paste the following code into the **Teaser** field and use the preview to make sure it looks good:

       {{page.code1}}
6. As you type, the preview below the template field will update using data from the first feature in the layer.

6. Click **Save**. The settings panel will close and the map will render again. Move your mouse over some points to see the tooltips.

### Allowed HTML

For security, unsafe HTML in tooltips is sanitized and JavaScript code is removed. If you want to build sophisticated map interaction with JavaScript on your own website, you can write custom code using the [Wax](http://mapbox.com/wax/) library.
