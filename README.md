# TileMill Github Pages Documentation

TileMill documentation is kept in the gh-pages branch, which is independently managed and not merged with master.

TileMill's in-app reference, available as the "Manual", (see below for syncing details) is a very small subset of docs for offline usage and is manually sync'ed from the gh-pages branch.

To checkout the gh-pages branch, do the following:

    git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/tilemill-project/tilemill.git tilemill-gh-pages

You can find more info about how to keep the documentation up to date in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.MD) file
