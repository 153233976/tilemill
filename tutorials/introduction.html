Introduction
============

TileMill is a tool for cartographers to quickly and easily design maps
for the web using custom data.  It is built on the powerful open-source 
map rendering library [Mapnik][], the same software
[OpenStreetMap][] and [MapQuest][] use to make some of their maps.
TileMill is not intended to be a general-purpose cartography tool, but
rather focuses on streamlining and simplifying a narrow set of use
cases.

[MapQuest]: http://open.mapquest.com/

For anyone coming from a GIS or cartography background, the biggest
assumption TileMill makes is the final projection - TileMill maps are
always projected to 'Web Mercator'. As the name suggests, this
projection is popular with web mapping applications, thus maps created
with TileMill can be displayed using the Google Maps API, OpenLayers,
and a number of other projects.

TileMill can also export directly to the SQLite-based [MBTiles][] file
format. This format was designed to make traditional web maps available
offline and is used by Maps on a Stick and the [MapBox iPad App][].

GIS Basics
==========

If you have never worked in GIS or cartography before, there a number of
basics to go over before jumping into TileMill.

GIS stands for Geographic Information System and refers to any system
dealing with the recording, analysis, or display of data that is related
to a location. TileMill is focused on the 'display' part of that
definition, but does provide some tools for basic analysis. Cartography
is the practice of making maps.

## Map projections

**TODO**

## Zoom Levels

Interactive, tiled maps are designed and rendered at a number of
different scalesA zoom level is a predefined scale at which a map is
rendered. OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, and most other online maps zoom
levels are scaled such that the entire world fills a 256x256 pixel tile
at zoom level 0, and doubles in width & height at each subsequent zoom
level. 

For example: at zoom level 6 you get a full view of a medium-sized
country.  At zoom level 11 you're looking at a metropolitan-region-sized
area. At Zoom level 16 you're down to a neighborhood scale.
