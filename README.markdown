LetsMove
========

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to move a running Mac OS X application to the Applications folder.

It first checks if /Applications is writable and offer to move it there if it is. If not, it sees if ~/Applications
exists and offers to move it there instead.

Requirements
------------
Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)
