Now that you've exported your map and created an [MBTiles](/mbtiles-spec) file, you can upload your map to MapBox Hosting.

We'll use the earthquakes layer you exported in the previous section and upload directly to your account through TileMill.  

1. Click the **Upload** button in the TileMill exports panel.

2. You will see a popup with a preview of your map so you can check it one last time. Once you're ready click the **Start Upload** button.

5. At this time, your map will open up in your default browser and you will see a preview of your map. This preview map is temporary and will expire after 7 days unless you *publish* the map to a MapBox account. If you haven't signed up for an account, click **[Plans & Pricing](http://mapbox.com/plans)** to sign up for an account.

6. If you already have an account at this point, now is the time to login. After you login, you will be taken back to the map preview. Click the **Publish this map** button to publish your map to your account.
