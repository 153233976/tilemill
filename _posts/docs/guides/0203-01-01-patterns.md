With TileMill, you can easily fill areas with textures and patterns by bringing in external images. You might create the patterns yourself in image editing software such as [GIMP](http://gimp.org) or [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org), or find ready-made images from resource websites such as [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/thumbnail-view/) or [Free Seamless Textures](http://freeseamlesstextures.com/).

## Adding a pattern

You can add a pattern style from any local file or web URL using the `polygon-pattern-file` style. Here is a simple diagonal stripe pattern you can use to try out - you can reference it from CartoCSS as in the snippet below.

    polygon-pattern-file: url("http://tilemill.com/assets/pages/pattern-stripe.png");

For organization it's a good idea to save and store images resources like this on your computer, for example inside your TileMill project folder. To see an example of this look at the Open Streets DC example: open your Documents directory in a file manager and navigate to MapBox→project→open-streets-dc. You can see that there is a subdirectory named 'images' and there are a couple of pattern images inside of it.

Images are stored inside the TileMill project they can be *relatively referenced*, meaning you don't need to specify the full path of the file location. Your style would simply be `polygon-pattern-file: url("images/water.png");`. Doing this also makes the TileMill project more portable, for example if you want move it to a different computer.

### As a background-image

The background of your map can also have a pattern with the `background-image` property:

    Map {
      background-image: url("http://tilemill.com/assets/pages/pattern-stripe.png");
    }

Like all other properties on the `Map` object, background-image has a global effect - it cannot be filtered or changed depending on zoom level.

## Ensuring seamlessness

There are two types of pattern alignment: local (the default) and global (specified with `polygon-pattern-alignment: global;`).

When a pattern style has local alignment, that means that the pattern will be aligned separately for each polygon it is applied to. The top-left corner of the pattern image will be aligned to the top-left corner of a polygon's bounding box.

When a pattern style has global alignment, pattern images are aligned to the [metatile](/tilemill/docs/guides/metatiles/) instead of the geometries. Thus a repeated pattern will line up across all of the polygons it is applied to. With global alignment, pattern images should not be larger than the metatile (excluding the buffer), otherwise portions of the pattern will never be shown.

Another important thing to keep in mind is with globally-aligned patterns is that the pixel dimensions of the image file must multiply evenly up to the width and height of the metatile. If your metatile size is the default of 2, your metatile is 512 pixels wide and tall (2×256). Your pattern width or height dimentions could be 16 or 32 or 128, but should not 20 or 100 or any other number you can't evenly divide 512 by. If you are using patterns from a resource website, you may need to resize them in an image editor to conform to this limitation.
