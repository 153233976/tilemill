Interface Tour
==============

If you've got TileMill running on your computer, you can access the web
interface in any modern web browser at <http://localhost:8889> (by
default; this address is configurable). The main TileMill screen
is a project browser, and you will see a few example projects there
already to give you an idea of what TileMill can do. 

<!-- TODO: More about the main page -->

## The editing interface

If you click on one of the projects you will be taken to the editing
interface:

<!-- TODO: labeled screenshot of the editing UI -->

1. Main toolbar
2. Map preview
3. Layers list
4. Colors & fonts palette
5. Code editor

### Main toolbar

<!-- TODO: labeled screenshot of main toolbar -->

1. Settings button
2. Project name
3. Save button
4. Export menu - export your map to a PNG image or to an MBTiles 
   file; you can also view past exports
5. Close project - returns to the main screen

### Map preview

<!-- TODO: labeled screenshot of map preview -->

1. Map preview
2. Zoom indicator & controls
3. Full-page toggle

TileMill provides an interactive preview of the map as you are designing
it. The map updates every time you save the project. 

You can pan around by clicking and dragging, and zoom in and out
clicking on the + and - buttons. Zooming can also be controlled with
your mouse wheel when the cursor is over the map, or by holding down the
Shift key and drawing a box on the map of the area you wish to zoom to.
The zoom level indicator displays the current zoom level, which is
useful to know when designing and checking styles.

The full-page toggle button expands the size of the preview, and
collapses it back once you are in the big-preview mode.

When you save a project TileMill also saves the position and scale you
were viewing the map at, so if you are only mapping a small area such as
a city you won't have to zoom in there every time you reopen the
project.

### Layers list

<!-- TODO: labeled screenshot of layer list -->

1. Add layer button
2. Draggable area
3. Geometry icon
4. IDs and classes
5. Inspect layer data
6. Edit layer
7. Delete layer

Clicking the add layer button opens a dialog where you can choose a
shapefile, KML file, GeoJSON file, or GeoTIFF to add to the project.
Each layer must have one ID (indicated by the `#` prefix), and may
optionally have one or more classes (indicated by a `.` prefix). These
are defined when the layer is added but can be changed any time by
clicking the 'Edit layer' icon.

A layer can be easily reordered by clicking in the striped draggable
area and moving it above or below another layer. Overlapping areas of
layers will be rendered such that the highest layer on the list will
cover layers beneath it.

For the purposes of styling, a layer can be one of four types of
geometries - point, line, polygon, or raster. This is indicated by the
geometry icon. Certain types of styles are only applicable to certain
types of layers, so it's good to know what each one is.

### Layer data inspector

<!-- TODO: screenshot -->

If you click on the magnifying glass icon of any layer, a drawer will
slide in from the left and a table of data will appear. (It may take a
few seconds for the data to show up if you are inspecting a complex
file.)

### Color palette

TileMill keeps track of all the colors you use in a project, and makes
it easy to edit them and add new ones. <!-- TODO: expand section -->

### Fonts list

Clicking on the 'Fonts' tab next to 'Colors'; will switch the panel
display to a list of all the system fonts Mapnik can find. You can
filter the list by typing in the text box, or scroll through the list to
find what you're looking for. Clicking on a font will insert its name
(in quotes) to the code where your cursor is.

Unlike what you may be used to from CSS or common word processor
interfaces, there are no distinct properties for a font's family (eg
'Arial'), weight (eg bold), and style (eg italic). This is why, for
example, "Arial Regular", "Arial Bold", and "Arial Italic" are listed
individually.

### Code editor

<!-- TODO: labeled screenshot of editor -->

1. Active stylesheet tab
2. Delete stylesheet
3. Inactive stylesheet tabs
4. New stylesheet button
5. Line numbers
6. Text area

TileMill provides an integrated code editor for editing the map
stylesheets. This editor will make sure you write valid code, coloring
correctly formatted text as you write it (syntax highlighting) and
highlighting any errors if you try to save an invalid file.

As your map style becomes more complex, you may wish to keep things
organized by splitting the style across multiple files. New stylesheets
can be added with the + button on the tab bar and entering a name for
the file. Though not required, there is a convention of using the file
extention `.mss` for 'map stylesheet'.

Stylesheets can be re-ordered by clicking and dragging their tabs within
the tab bar. Note that just like CSS, the order can have an effect on
the way a map is rendered - if two styles conflict, the one that is
defined last will be applied. Here, 'last' means closest to the bottom
of the file in the tab furthest to the right.
