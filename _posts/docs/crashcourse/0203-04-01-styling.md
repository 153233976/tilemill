TileMill uses a language called **Carto** to determine the look of your map. Colors, sizes and shapes can all be manipulated by applying their relative Carto parameters in the panel to the right of the map. [Visit the manual](/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/) for an intro to Carto.

In the [tutorial on adding layers](/tilemill/docs/tutorials/point-data), you added an earthquake point layer using the **Save and Style** button. This button automatically added several styling parameters and gave them an initial value.

1. `#earthquakes`  
The layer to which the styles are applied.

2. `marker-width`  
The size of the markers. If `marker-height` is not specified, it is given the same value, resulting in a circle marker. Try changing this number and view the resulting map. Remember to click **Save** after any changes.

3. `marker-fill`  
The color of the inside of the marker. There are two methods to changing color values. You can type in a new hex or RGB value, or you can use the **color swatches** at the bottom of the Carto panel.

Try changing the marker color by clicking the light red swatch and selecting a new color. Notice the corresponding color value is updated in the Carto. Again, click **Save** to see your changes.

4. `marker-line-color`  
The color of the border of the marker. This time try changing the color by replacing the hex value `#813` with `#000`, the code for black. Notice that the color swatch is updated with the new color. Click **Save**.

5. `marker-allow-overlap`  
This allows markers to be placed on top of each other. If this is not specified or set to `false`, potentially overlapping markers will not be displayed.

These are just a few of the basic parameters for displaying markers. For a comprehensive look at styling possibilities, checkout the **Carto reference** section in TileMill.
